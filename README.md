ABOUT Haar cascade:
Haar Cascade is a machine learning-based approach where a lot of positive and negative images are used to train the classifier. Positive images – These images contain the images which we want our classifier to identify. Negative Images – Images of everything else, which do not contain the object we want to detect.
